        Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can analyze patterns, make decisions, and solve problems based on past experiences or examples. ML is widely used in various fields like healthcare, finance, marketing, and more, for tasks such as predicting diseases, detecting fraud, and recommending products.
