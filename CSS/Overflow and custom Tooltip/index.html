        Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can analyze patterns, make decisions, and solve problems based on past experiences or examples. ML is widely used in various fields like healthcare, finance, marketing, and more, for tasks such as predicting diseases, detecting fraud, and recommending products.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data; unsupervised learning, where the model finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where the model learns by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties. ML models are trained using large amounts of data, and their accuracy improves as they are exposed to more information.

Some popular ML techniques include decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and clustering algorithms. These models help machines make intelligent decisions similar to human reasoning. For example, ML is used in voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant, email spam filters, and even self-driving cars.

In short, machine learning gives computers the ability to act and make decisions automatically by learning from data, which is transforming how we interact with technology in our daily lives.
